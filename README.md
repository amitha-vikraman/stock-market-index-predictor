# Stock Market Index Prediction Using LSTM and Twitter Sentiment Analysis

## A project that predicts the closing price of S&P500 index using fundamental data, macro-economic data and twitter sentiment analysis

## Introduction
The aim of this project is to predict the Closing price of S&P500 index based on historical data (fundamental features), macro-economic data aided with Twitter Sentiment Analysis using LSTM model. The macro-economic parameters such as Interest Rates and Inflation Rates along with Tweets about major 4 companies of S&P500 index were used along with historical data and predictions were done. Hyperparameter tuning and a comparison of root mean squared error and mean 
absolute percentage error generated through each of the combinations were observed.

## How to get started
The code can be run using a jupyter notebook. 

### TODO
The data used in this project will be uploaded in Kaggle and link will be shared soon.
